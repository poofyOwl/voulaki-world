I am participating in the very first Ocean Song Project cohort as a Musician and as Co-Manager & Facilitator. I will be part of a diverse community of artists who will create original music that reflects our relationships to the ocean, raises awareness, and offers powerful new ways to
engage people in the importance of a healthy blue world.

_**Coming Soon!**_
