Hello! My name is Vou (they/them). Welcome to the online portal into my world. 

I'm a music producer, an audio and software engineer, and a DJ. One of my favourite things to do is sonic storytelling. I love multidisciplinary, weird, interesting, abstract, and challenging projects. All my music is available to download in high quality for free on Bandcamp and SoundCloud. I'm open to collaborations, including trades :)
